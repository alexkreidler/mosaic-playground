# Mosaic Playground

Edit and explore [Mosaic](https://idl.uw.edu/mosaic/) visualizations in your browser. Inspired by the [Vega Editor](https://vega.github.io/editor/#/).

Features:
- Re-renders chart whenever the JSON specification changes. Keeps the last working version when there is an error
- Includes example specifications from the Mosaic website (loads latest versions directly from the Github repo)
- Shows errors as toasts and in the console
- Download SVG or PNG of chart (doesn't include legends, parameters, or concatenated charts)
